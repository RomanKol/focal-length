# Focal Length comparison
Compare different focal lengths on various sensors

## Todos
* Add a visual comparison for sensors sizes
  * eg via svg, maybe real live size
* Add an additional visual comparison for the field of view
  * maybe with [three.js](https://threejs.org)
* ~~Free selection of BOTH sensors for comparison (instead of 35mm sensor)~~
  * ~~maybe even more than two?~~
* Refactor with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
